# Data sources & licenses

## What’s in this repo
This POC ships **only simulated telematics** generated by `bin/simulate_stream.py`.  
No real-world or PII data is included.

- Format: **JSONL** (one JSON object per line)
- Fields per record (units):
  - `timestamp` (ISO 8601, UTC)
  - `driver_id`, `trip_id` (strings)
  - `speed_mps` (m/s), `accel_long_mps2` (m/s²), `accel_lat_mps2` (m/s²), `jerk_mps3` (m/s³)
  - `heading_deg` (0–360), `gps_lat`, `gps_lon` (approximate, synthetic path)
  - `time_of_day` ∈ {morning, midday, evening, night}
  - `road_type` ∈ {highway, city, rural}
  - `weather` ∈ {clear, rain, snow, fog}

From these records, features are derived in-code (see `src/features/featurize.py`), e.g.:
- Distance (`dist_km`), duration (`duration_sec`), sample rate (`hz`)
- Event rates per 100 km: `hard_brake_rate_100km`, `harsh_accel_rate_100km`, `corner_rate_100km`
- Speed stats: `avg_speed`, `p50_speed`, `p95_speed`, `std_speed`
- Jerk stats: `jerk_mean`, `jerk_p95`
- Context shares: `speeding_exposure`, `idle_share`, `night_mile_share`, `rain_mile_share`

All **simulated data and code** in this repository are released under the repo’s MIT license (see `LICENSE`).

## Optional external datasets (not included)
If you’d like to validate on public telematics/behavior datasets, add them **offline** and update paths locally.  
Examples (check licenses before use):
- UAH DriveSet
- AXA telematics challenge datasets
- Other academic driving behavior corpora

> Keep real driver data out of the repo. If used, store securely and reference via local paths or secrets.
